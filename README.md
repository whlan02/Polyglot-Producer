# Polyglot Producer

**A project to help you learn languages in an easier way.**

## Getting Started

Welcome to the Polyglot Producer project! This repository is designed to help you learn new languages more efficiently. Below are the steps to get started with the project.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Python 3.x**: You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **VS Code**: Recommended for a better development experience. Download it from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- **Git**: If you haven't already, install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

### Installation

#### 1. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/whlan02/Polyglot-Producer.git
cd Polyglot-Producer
```

#### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

In VS Code, open the project folder and run the following command in the terminal to create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

#### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

- On **Windows**:
  
  ```bash
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- On **Linux/macOS**:
  
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

After activation, `(venv)` will be displayed at the beginning of the terminal prompt, indicating that the virtual environment is active.

#### 4. Install Dependencies

In the activated virtual environment, run the following command to install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 5. Select the Virtual Environment in VS Code

1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` to open the command palette.
2. Type and select **Python: Select Interpreter**.
3. Choose the virtual environment you created (the path is usually `./venv/bin/python` or `./venv/Scripts/python.exe`).

### Run the project

After setting up the virtual environment and installing the dependencies, you can run the project by executing the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

Follow the instructions provided by the script to start learning languages in an easier way!
